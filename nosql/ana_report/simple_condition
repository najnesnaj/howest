Here's the updated version of your generate_random_data() function that ensures:

    Exactly 4 values > 80

    Each of those peaks is at least 8 indices apart

    The difference between any two consecutive values is ≤ 20

    Values stay within 1–100

    Other rules stay the same


Notes

    Works with n ≥ 33 (because 4 peaks need 3×8=24 spacing).

    If n is bigger, peaks are more spread out randomly.

    Only 4 values will be above 80.

    All other values are ≤ 80.
