Overview
========



	- ana_report

this contains the Docker container with a FastAPI to consult&plot the data 

	- ana_model

here the model is generated, this is used for experimenting with an LLM 

	- ana_github_actions

the purpose is to use github actions to build the Docker container. I want to have github build the model as well, based on an LLM generated python function that describes the disered pattern. This way a user can feed any pattern into the container and filter the database for similar patterns.

	- ana_check

this is a script that gets from ana_report all the companies, and then checks if they match the desired pattern, and create an entry in the database
