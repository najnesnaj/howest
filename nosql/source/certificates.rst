Setting up Certificates for a Docker Registry on Talos
========================================================

Overview
--------

This guide explains how to configure certificate-based authentication for a private Docker registry running in a Talos Kubernetes cluster, using internal certificates rather than external ones.

Certificate Setup Approaches
----------------------------

There are several approaches to solve this:

1. Use a self-signed certificate and configure Docker to trust it
2. Set up an internal Certificate Authority (CA) in your cluster
3. Use Kubernetes cert-manager for certificate management

This guide focuses on approach #2, which provides a good balance of security and control.

Step 1: Create a Certificate for your Registry
----------------------------------------------

First, you'll need to create a certificate for your registry. If you already have an internal CA, you can use it. Otherwise, you'll need to create one.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create directory for certificates
   mkdir -p certs
   cd certs

   # Generate a private key for your CA
   openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096

   # Create a CA certificate
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out ca.crt \
     -subj "/CN=Internal CA"

   # Create a private key for your registry
   openssl genrsa -out registry.key 4096

   # Create a certificate signing request (CSR)
  
   openssl req -new -key registry.key -out registry.csr \
     -subj "/CN=registry.yourdomain.local" \
     -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:registry.example.com"

   # Sign the certificate with your CA
   openssl x509 -req -in registry.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
     -CAcreateserial -out registry.crt -days 365 -sha256 \
     -extfile <(echo "subjectAltName = DNS:registry.example.com")

.. note::
   Make sure to replace ``registry.yourdomain.local`` with your registry's actual hostname throughout this guide.

Step 2: Configure Your Registry with the Certificates
----------------------------------------------------

Create a Kubernetes secret with your certificates:

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl create secret generic registry-certs \
     --from-file=tls.crt=./certs/registry.crt \
     --from-file=tls.key=./certs/registry.key \
     -n default

Update your registry deployment to use these certificates:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: registry
     namespace: registry
   spec:
     # ...
     template:
       # ...
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: registry
           image: registry:2
           ports:
           - containerPort: 5000
           volumeMounts:
           - name: registry-certs
             mountPath: /certs
             readOnly: true
           # ...
           env:
           - name: REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE
             value: /certs/tls.crt
           - name: REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY
             value: /certs/tls.key
         volumes:
         - name: registry-certs
           secret:
             secretName: registry-certs

Step 3: Configure Docker Clients to Trust the Certificate
--------------------------------------------------------

On each machine that will push to your registry:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Copy your CA certificate to the Docker certs directory
   # Replace registry.yourdomain.local with your registry's hostname
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/registry.yourdomain.local
   sudo cp ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/registry.yourdomain.local/ca.crt

   # Restart Docker to apply changes
   sudo systemctl restart docker

For Talos machines, you'll need to add the CA certificate to the machine configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   machine:
     files:
       - content: |
           -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
           # Your CA certificate content here
           -----END CERTIFICATE-----
         permissions: 0644
         path: /etc/ssl/certs/registry-ca.crt

Step 4: Test Pushing to Your Registry
-------------------------------------

Now you should be able to push images to your registry:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Tag an image for your registry
   docker tag myimage:latest registry.yourdomain.local:5000/myimage:latest

   # Push to your registry
   docker push registry.yourdomain.local:5000/myimage:latest

Alternative: Use Insecure Registry
---------------------------------

.. warning::
   This approach is not recommended for production environments!

If you're just testing and don't want to deal with certificates temporarily:

1. Configure Docker to use insecure registry:

   .. code-block:: json

      # Add this to /etc/docker/daemon.json
      {
        "insecure-registries": ["registry.yourdomain.local:5000"]
      }

2. For Talos nodes, add to your machine configuration:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      machine:
        registries:
          config:
            registry.yourdomain.local:5000:
              tls:
                insecureSkipVerify: true

Troubleshooting
--------------

Common issues and solutions:

Certificate Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you encounter certificate verification errors, check that:

- The CA certificate has been correctly copied to all client machines
- The hostname in your registry URL matches exactly what's in the certificate's SAN field
- The certificates haven't expired (check with ``openssl x509 -in registry.crt -text -noout``)

Registry Connection Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can't connect to the registry:

- Verify the registry service is running: ``kubectl get pods -n registry``
- Check that the registry service is exposed: ``kubectl get svc -n registry``
- Ensure network policies allow traffic to the registry port
