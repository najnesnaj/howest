Gitignore tricks
================

most likely, you would like to avoid some files getting published on github (especially if you are using a public repository). Here are some common files that you might want to ignore:
(files containing api tokens, passwords, etc.)


If you are anything like me, you'll notice this too late in the process. 

trick:
------
.. code-block:: bash

    git rm -r --cached source/_build
    git rm -r --cached source/
    git reset HEAD source/
    vi .gitignore
    git add .gitignore (add the file you do not want to publish)
    git commit -m "removed source/_build from git"
    git push origin master

Sphinx:
-------
Sphinx has a build directory, in which files are generated. You might want to ignore this directory as well, as it contains many files that change.
