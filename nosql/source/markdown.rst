Markdown
========
Markdown: A lightweight, human-readable markup language widely used for documentation, blogs, and README files (e.g., on GitHub). It’s simple, portable, and supported by many tools.

In a recent post, AI researcher Andrej Karpathy made a bold observation:

“It’s 2025 and most content is still written for humans instead of LLMs. 99.9% of attention is about to be LLM attention, not human attention.”

He argues that documentation, knowledge bases, and even entire content ecosystems are still designed with human readability in mind, when in reality, large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming the dominant consumers of information. In a world where AI is both the reader and interpreter, should we rethink how we write? Should we optimize for AI comprehension first, human engagement second?

Karpathy’s argument—that LLMs will soon dominate content attention—supports Markdown over Sphinx RST for its simplicity, ubiquity, and alignment with machine-readable workflows. Markdown’s lightweight syntax is easier for LLMs to parse, its ecosystem is broader, and it bridges human and machine needs during the transition to LLM-centric content consumption.
