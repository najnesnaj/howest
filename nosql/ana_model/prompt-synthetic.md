can you create a python script that generates 2 types of data.  They will be usefull to train an ai neural net afterwards that has a binary outcome:  contains pattern / contains random. The script has to generate 5000 arrays containing 70 values, ranging from 1 to 100.    The difference between any two consecutive values is â‰¤ 20, for all the data. For the data that contains the pattern : Exactly 4 values > 80, each of those peaks is at least 8 indices apart.
